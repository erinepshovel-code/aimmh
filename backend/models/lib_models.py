"""
lib_models.py — Pydantic request/response models for the /api/v1/lib/ routes.

Design:
  - ModelSlot bundles a model_id with an optional context override, allowing
    the same model to appear multiple times with different system prompts.
  - verbosity (1-10) uses pop-culture reference metrics to set response length.
  - role_preset maps named archetypes (debate, social, roleplay) to system prompts.
